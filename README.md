IBM Data Scientist Dashboard and Visualizations Notebook
Description:

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook developed for an IBM Data Scientist assignment. The notebook is structured into two main parts:

Data Visualizations:

Line Charts, Scatter Plots, Bubble Charts, and Pie Charts: Demonstrates various visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Analyses Include:
Yearly automobile sales trends.
Sales trends by vehicle type.
Comparison of sales during recession vs. non-recession periods.
Impact of seasonality on automobile sales.
Correlation between average vehicle price and sales volume during recession.
The effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle sales.
Interactive Dash Application:

Dashboard Features:
A meaningful title and a dropdown menu to switch between reports.
Two interactive reports: a Recession Report and an Annual Report.
Graphs created using Plotly integrated into the Dash framework.
Purpose:
To provide an interactive way to explore the visualizations and data trends related to automobile sales and economic indicators.
Technologies and Libraries Used:

Python 3.x
pandas – Data manipulation and aggregation
numpy – Numerical operations and random data generation
matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
plotly & dash – Interactive dashboards
How to Use This Repository:

Clone or Download the Repository:
Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine or download it directly.

Open the Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook (IBM_Data_Scientist_Dashboard.ipynb) in your favorite Jupyter environment. Ensure that your virtual environment (located at C:\Users\raffa\Downloads\IBM Data Scientist) has all the required libraries installed.

Run the Cells:
Execute the cells in order to view the data visualizations and interact with the Dash application.

Running the Dash App:
To run the Dash app, execute the last cell. The application will start, and you can view it in your web browser (typically at http://127.0.0.1:8050). If you are using Jupyter Notebook, consider using JupyterDash for an inline experience.

Project Objective:

This project demonstrates practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and interactive dashboard development using Python. It is designed to showcase proficiency in data science and analytics as required by the IBM Data Scientist assignment.
